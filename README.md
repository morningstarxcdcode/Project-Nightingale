// Fetch data from API
const data = await fetchData('your-api-endpoint');

// Post data to API
const result = await postData('your-api-endpoint', yourData);
```



result = simple_ai_model("Your code or data here")
print(result)  # Output: "Processed data: Your code or data here"
```

```python
# Networking functionality
from scripts.networking import fetch_data_from_api

data = fetch_data_from_api("https://api.example.com/data")
```
