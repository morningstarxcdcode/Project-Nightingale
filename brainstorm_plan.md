# Project Nightingale GitHub Organization Setup Plan

## Introduction

Project Nightingale aims to illuminate the future of cybersecurity through open-source Artificial Intelligence. This plan outlines the steps to establish a robust GitHub organization and project repository, ensuring a welcoming environment for contributors and users alike.

## Phase 1: Organization Foundation (Immediate Actions)

1. **Finalize Organization Settings:**
   - **Profile:** Add a compelling avatar/logo, a concise website link (if you have one or plan a GitHub Pages site), and a detailed description.
   - **Security:** Ensure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is enabled on your personal GitHub account. Then, enforce 2FA for all members of your organization in the organization settings.
   - **Member Privileges:** Set base permissions for new repositories (start with "Write" for trusted collaborators or "Read/Triage" for a controlled phase). Decide who can create public and private repositories (start with "Members" for public, "Owners" for private).
   - **Repository Defaults:** Set the default branch name to `main`.
   - **Create Initial Teams:** Based on your initial collaborators and their roles (e.g., Core Developers, AI Research, Security Analysts, Documentation). Set their privacy to "Secret" initially.

2. **Create the Primary Project Repository:**
   - Ensure your "Project-Nightingale" repository exists. If not, create it under your organization.

3. **Add Essential Files to the "Project-Nightingale" Repository:**
   - **`README.md`:**
